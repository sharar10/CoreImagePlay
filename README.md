# CoreImagePlay

Playing around with CoreImage on iOS.

## The goal:
* This project is a stepping stone to remove dependency on the `GPUImage` framework used in another project I'm involved in.
* I am simply replicating some of the functionality that `GPUImage` offered using `CoreImage`, `AVFoundation` etc.

### To dos:
* filter video in capture device
* Video capture
* Filter live video
* Filter for export.
* Handle export
* Camera modes (juxtapose mirror-l, mirror-r, blur)
