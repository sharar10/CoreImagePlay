# CoreImagePlay

Playing around with CoreImage on iOS.

## The goal:
* This project is a stepping stone to remove dependency on the `GPUImage` framework used in another project I'm involved in.
* I am simply replicating some of the functionality that `GPUImage` offered using `CoreImage`, `AVFoundation` etc.

### To dos:
* Filter video on live view from a capture device
    * Add camera modes (juxtapose mirror-l, mirror-r, blur)
* Capture video and save
* Filter a video for export
* Handle export
